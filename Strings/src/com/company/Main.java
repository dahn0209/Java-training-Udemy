        System.out.println("lastString is equal to "+lastString); //lastString is equal to 1050120.47
//        So in the case of this code, lastString doesn't get appended the value "120.47"
//        instead a new String is created which consists of the previous value of lastString plus a text representation
//        of the double value 120.47
//        -The net result is the same, lastString has the right values, however, a new String got created and the old one got discarded.
